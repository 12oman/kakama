Covid changed the exibition possibilities in a basic sense.
Originally going to do an exhibition in June:

## work is about inclusion and diversity, everything starts with a diversity of thought

### diversity of material
### diversity of presentation
### diversity of 

alignments

6 months of 

transition 

andrew an I are about to enter into a month of transition. Society is going trhough a huge transition. 

Humanity will survive, but we need an agility of minds and spirits.

White box thing is not going to survive. 

how we can get through things in a positive way. 

### Landscape shift

Control Undo
Control Save
### Flexibility

what I'm trying to do is get beyond the tightly coupled exhibition. It could still be concieved as a solo exhibition or solo work, it's not about de-authoring. But I would like the exhibition to be increasingly able to be performed by others, without my needing to couch it along. 

The person who invited me to exhibit at MAC may not have a job.
